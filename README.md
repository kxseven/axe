## What is AXE and how can it help me?

The AXE tools are a collection of Python and BASH helper scripts that are intended to augment your existing interaction with AWS by;

- Helping with the loading of AWS credentials into the environment that can be re-used by all of your existing AWS toolset; Terraform, AWS CLI, Terraforming, Ansible, etc
- Helping to generate useful information about existing resources you already have on AWS in a format that can be used as part of a pipeline for other tools/apps
